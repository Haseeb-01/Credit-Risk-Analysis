## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **XGBoost**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)**
- **Google Colab**

---

## 📊 Features

- Uses **SMOTE** to balance imbalanced datasets
- Trains and compares:
  - ✅ Random Forest Classifier
  - ✅ XGBoost Classifier
- Plots **ROC curves** for both models
- Calculates and displays **AUC (Area Under the Curve)**
- Suitable for any binary classification dataset

## 🧠 Real-World Use Cases

This approach can be used in real-life projects such as:

- Fraud detection
- Medical diagnosis (e.g. disease prediction)
- Spam classification
- Loan approval risk modeling
